**See which dispensary deals are worth it—right on the menu.**

Daily Dispo Deals Deal Checker overlays simple value badges on cannabis dispensary menu pages so you can spot the best deals at a glance. No sign-up required.

**How it works**
1. Open a dispensary menu on Weedmaps or Dutchie (or Dutchie-powered sites like mindrightmi.com).
2. Click the extension icon and tap **Analyze this page**.
3. Each product gets a badge: **Worth It** (good value), **Mid** (average), or **Taxed** (overpriced).
4. A sidebar opens with the full scored list, filters, and price-per-gram info.

**Features**
- Works on Weedmaps and Dutchie menus
- Local scoring—no account needed
- Worth It / Mid / Taxed badges with $/g or $/100mg
- Filter by product type (flower, vape, edible, etc.)
- Pagination and keyboard shortcuts
- Built in Michigan with cannabis consumers in mind

**Supported sites**
- Weedmaps (weedmaps.com)
- Dutchie (dutchie.com)
- Dutchie-powered dispensary sites (e.g. mindrightmi.com)

**Privacy**
Scoring runs locally. Optional data may be sent to Daily Dispo Deals only when you use the extension, for comparison features. See our privacy policy for details.
