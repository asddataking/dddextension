# Privacy Policy for Daily Dispo Deals – Deal Checker

**Last updated:** [Add date]

**Effective for:** Daily Dispo Deals – Deal Checker Chrome Extension

---

## Overview

Daily Dispo Deals Deal Checker ("the Extension") helps users evaluate cannabis dispensary deals by overlaying value badges on menu pages. This policy describes what data we collect and how we use it.

---

## Data We Collect

### Data stored locally (on your device only)
- **Device/Install ID** – A random identifier generated when you first use the extension, stored in Chrome's local storage. Used for future account linking if you choose to connect.
- **Cached analysis results** – When you analyze a menu page, we may cache the results locally so we can re-apply badges without re-analyzing. This cache is stored only on your device.

### Data we may receive (only when you use the extension)
When you click **Analyze** on a supported menu page, the extension may send the following to our servers at dailydispodeals.com:
- **Menu data** – Product names, prices, weights, and categories extracted from the page
- **Install ID** – To associate requests with your installation (not linked to your identity)
- **Extension version** – For compatibility and support

We do **not** collect:
- Your name, email, or account information (unless you explicitly sign up)
- Browsing history outside of the pages you choose to analyze
- Payment or financial information

---

## How We Use Data

- **To provide the service** – Score deals, show badges, and offer comparison features
- **To improve the extension** – Understand usage patterns and fix issues
- **To comply with law** – When required by applicable law

---

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. We may share data only:
- With service providers who help us operate (e.g. hosting)
- When required by law or to protect our rights

---

## Your Choices

- **Don't analyze** – If you don't click Analyze, no data is sent to our servers
- **Clear badges** – Use the Clear button to remove overlays; this does not delete cached data
- **Uninstall** – Removing the extension deletes locally stored data

---

## Security

We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

---

## Changes

We may update this policy. We will post the updated policy at the same URL and update the "Last updated" date.
